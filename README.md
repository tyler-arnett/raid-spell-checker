The purpose of this plugin is to allow the player to
configure which spellbook and specific spells they
bring into each raid. If the player is on a different
spellbook than what is selected for the raid, a sound
effect will play and a message will appear in the chat.
If the player is on the correct spellbook but is missing
some of the runes to cast the selected spells from
that spellbook, a sound effect will play and a message
will appear in the chat. Sound effect and volume are configurable.
You can select a custom sound and place your own .wav file into
the sounds folder (\raid-spell-checker\src\main\resources\sounds)
and specify the name (MyCustomSound.wav).
